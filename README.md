I've built an interactive web platform to help people understand and avoid digital payment scams.
Users go through story-driven and quizzes, learning to spot scams in a fun way.
Instant feedback and tips guide them, so they remember safe practices.
Gamification elements like points, badges, and a leaderboard keep users motivated and engaged.

Raise awareness about digital payment frauds in an easy-to-understand way.
Help users avoid falling for scams by learning through experience.
Make learning fun, engaging, and memorable instead of boring.
Build a platform that is scalable, interactive, and socially impactful for more people to benefit.
